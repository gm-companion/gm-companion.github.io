GM-Companion is a free and open-source application written by a computer science student
who enjoys playing tabletop RPGs and needed a good tool to assist with running them.
It aims to support the gamemaster by providing lots of different tools
that were developed whenever the GM said something along the lines of
"It would be nice if there was a tool for doing x".

We are explicitly focusing on classic offline sessions where people sit around a physical table,
instead of building yet another VTT solution (of which there already exist many good ones).

The goal is to make running RPGs easier and more enjoyable for everyone,
so if you have anything you want to see added or improved,
just get in contact by opening a <a href="https://github.com/PhilInTheGaps/GM-Companion/issues">GitHub Issue</a> or
starting a <a href="https://github.com/PhilInTheGaps/GM-Companion/discussions">GitHub Discussion</a>
and maybe someone will implement it.

Or you can always make changes yourself and help developing the GM-Companion.  
It's open source and help is always welcome.

Have fun playing!  

Phil
