GM-Companion version 1.0 has been released. Finally!

The last release (0.3.3) was nearly a year ago. Since then I have completely rewritten the UI (I switched from QT Widgets to QML), added a new tool, improved old tools and changed a lot of features back and forth until I was really happy with them.

Unfortunately I was not able to spend as much time developing the GM-Companion as I would have liked, but I am really proud of what it has become and hope that someone else will find it as useful as I do.

A big thank you to everyone who has helped me during the development by testing builds and giving feedback!

Have fun!
