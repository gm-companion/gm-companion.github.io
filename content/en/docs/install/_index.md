Currently only Linux and Windows (x86_64) are supported, but you can always try to [build from source](/docs/install/from-source).

## Windows

[Release 1.2.1 (x86_64)](https://github.com/PhilInTheGaps/GM-Companion/releases/download/1.2.1/gm-companion_1.2.1_win64.zip)

The program works without an installer. Simply extract all the files from the .zip archive to a folder and run _gm-companion.exe_.

## Linux

If your favorite OS is not listed below, then the AppImage is recommended.

You can of course always [build from source](/docs/install/from-source).

### Generic

[AppImage (x86_64)](https://github.com/PhilInTheGaps/GM-Companion/releases/download/1.2.1/gm-companion_1.2.1_x86_64.AppImage)

### Arch Linux

Install from [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gm-companion/):

```
yay -S gm-companion
```
