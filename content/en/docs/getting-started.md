### Spotify

Using Spotify with GM-Companion requires some additional steps first:

- Go to [Spotify developer page](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
- "Create an App"
- In app settings add _http://127.0.0.1:59991/_ as a redirect URI
- Go to GM-Companion settings, add "Client ID" and "Client Secret" of your app
- Restart GM-Companion
- You can now add Spotify playlists and albums as elements, the "_Audio Addon_" has some great RPG related playlists. You can add by adding a Spotify element and pressing "_Add from Addons_"

Note that playing Spotify playlists requires the Spotify app running in the background.
