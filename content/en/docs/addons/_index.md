## Custom Addons

You can of course create your own addons.
Have a look at the existing addons and modify them to your liking.

## Repositories

Addons are organized in repositories so that the application knows that they are available.
The main repository can be found [here](https://github.com/gm-companion/addons).

Custom repositories can of course be created and added to the application.

If you have created a new addon, please consider opening a pull request so that it can be added to the repo.
