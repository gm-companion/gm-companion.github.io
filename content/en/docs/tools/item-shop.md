Shops are managed in project files. By default these are located in this folder:  
_.../your-home-directory/**.gm-companion/shop**_

Every shop also belongs in a category, so create one first before trying to create any shops.

### Editing a shop

When you have created a project, category and a shop, select the shop on left.  
Now you can set a shop owner and add a short description.  
You can add items to your shop from the item list on the right. If the list is empty, open the item editor and create some items.

## Item Editor

Every item needs a category, so create one first.  
Enter the item name and select a category. Price and description are optional.  
When you are done, click "Add Item".  
You can now add your item to a shop.
