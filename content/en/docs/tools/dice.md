The dice tool is pretty much self-explanatory.  
Select dice by clicking on an icon or enter a custom amount of sides in the spinbox.  
You can also roll multiple dice at once and / or add a modifier. These modifiers can be positive or negative and are added to the resulting roll.


## Example
_3D6+4_  

Dice Count | Dice Sides | Modifier
---- | ---- | ------
3 | 6 | 4  

Result: 18  

### Detailed Information

The dice tool will also display more detailed information:

Roll:
3x D6 + 4

Roll 1: 3  
Roll 2: 5  
Roll 3: 6  

Temporary Result: 14  
Modifier: +4  
Result: 18

## Settings

The dice tool can indicate criticals by displaying the result in a different color than usual (green for success, red for failure, orange for mixed result).  
You can enable / disable this feature and also set what kind of results should count as a crit, either min / max result or fixed values.
