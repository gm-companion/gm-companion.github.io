## Adding Characters

1. Go to the _characters_ directory. (By default _/your/home/**.gm-companion/characters**)_  
2. Add character sheet (one of the following)
   1. Put a PDF file into the folder
   2. Create a new folder with the name of the character you want to add, for example: _Frank Lightspeed_.
      Put images of the character sheet pages to that folder and give them descriptive names.  
      An example could be _1 - Skills_, _2 - Equipment_ ...  
      Putting the page numbers first is recommended because inside the character tool the pages will be sorted in alphabetical order.
