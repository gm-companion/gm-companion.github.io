The character tool allows you to view the character sheets of your players.

## Adding Characters

1. Go to the _characters_ directory. (By default _/your/home/**.gm-companion/characters**)_  
2. Create a new folder with the name of the character you want to add, for example: _Frank Lightspeed_  
3. Copy images of the character sheet pages to that folder and give them  descriptive names. An example could be _1 - Skills_, _2 - Equipment_ ...  
I recomment putting the page numbers first because inside the character tool the pages will be sorted in alphabetical order.

On Linux PDFs are supported as well. Simply put a character sheet PDF in the _characters_ directory.
