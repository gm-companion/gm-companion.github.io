The map tool allows you to view images of maps.

Currently maps can only be of type .jpg or .png.  
You can zoom in and out or rotate the image. Drawing and making annotations are features planned for future versions.

## Setup

Maps have to be located inside subfolders inside your base maps folder.  
By default this base folder is _.../your-home-directory**/.gm-companion/maps**_.  
It can be changed in the [settings](/docs/settings).
