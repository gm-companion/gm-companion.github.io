### Sorting

Entries are sorted by their initiative value (highest first).
If two or more entries have the same value, their priority is used (again, highest value first).

### Delay Turn

The "delay turn" button can be used to move an entry to the end of the queue for this round. This will be reset when a new round starts.

## Dice

The combat tracker has a built in version of the [dice tool](/docs/tools/dice).
