## Usage

Enter a value into the left field and choose a unit below. It will be converted to the unit on the right.

GM-Companion comes with many common units included.

### Editor

Custom units can easily created using the unit editor.

1. Use the dialog to create a new project.
2. Create a category for your units.
3. Add your unit to the category.

{{% alert title="Unit value" color="primary" %}}
Units need to have a value relative to an arbitrary "reference unit".
This could be the relevant SI unit for a category or something completely different.
It is only important that this is kept consistent for all units in the category.
