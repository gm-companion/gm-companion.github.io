{{% blocks/feature icon="none" title="Is this a VTT solution?" %}}
No. This application is intended to be used at a physical table.

If you need a virtual tabletop then maybe have a look at [Fari App](https://fari.app/), [Ogres Tabletop](https://ogres.app/) or [MapTool](https://www.rptools.net/toolbox/maptool/), all of which are also free and open source.

{{% blocks/feature icon="none" title="Is this intended for a specific RPG system?" %}}
GM-Companion is system agnostic. Content specific to your favorite system might be available via unofficial addons.
{{% /blocks/feature %}}

{{% blocks/feature icon="none" title="Can I request features?" %}}
Yes, [right here](https://github.com/PhilInTheGaps/GM-Companion/issues)! But please be aware that this mostly a one-person-project and developed during free time.
So it will probably take some time until your feature is implemented.
Of course, implementing it yourself is also an option.

{{% blocks/feature icon="none" title="Do you accept contributions?" %}}
Yes! Have a look at the [GitHub page](https://github.com/PhilInTheGaps/GM-Companion) for more information.
{{% /blocks/feature %}}

{{% blocks/feature icon="none" title="I am not a programmer, can I still contribute?" %}}
Absolutely. You can report bugs, write translations, improve the documentation and more. Ask on [GitHub](https://github.com/PhilInTheGaps/GM-Companion/discussions) what is currently needed.
{{% /blocks/feature %}}

{{% blocks/feature icon="none" title="Is there a web version?" %}}
For the moment, GM-Companion is available for desktop only. But a web version is planned for the (far) future.
{{% /blocks/feature %}}

{{% blocks/feature icon="none" title="What about platform [...]?" %}}
Every additional platform means a lot more maintenance work and would require a larger development team.
That being said, the application is intentionally written to be cross-platform and ports to Android or Apple platforms should be possible.
{{% /blocks/feature %}}

{{% blocks/feature icon="none" title="What does this cost?" %}}
Your soul. Other than that, it's free forever. 
{{% /blocks/feature %}}

{{% blocks/feature icon="none" title="Any more questions?" %}}
Ask them on [GitHub](https://github.com/PhilInTheGaps/GM-Companion/discussions)!
