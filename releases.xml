Released version 0.3.1
</title>
<description>
 &lt;p&gt;Beta 3.1 has been released!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This update introduces a notes system, translation support and improves the UI.&lt;br /&gt; Custom Qt-StyleSheets are supported as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also introduces the concept of addons for specific rpg systems.&lt;br /&gt; This feature is still under development and will have more features in the future.&lt;br /&gt; Currently there are two addons available:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;DSA5 (The Dark Eye, though currently only available in German)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SIFRP (A Song of Ice and Fire Roleplaying)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Official addons for other systems will be available in the future and there will also be an Addon-Creator for you to create your own addons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addons can add system specific units to the unit converter, notes and the SIFRP addon enables a SIFRP House Generator.&lt;br /&gt; Again, this will change in future updates.&lt;br /&gt; Addons can be installed with the AddonManager via the new &quot;Options&quot; window.&lt;br /&gt; The AddonManager is written in Java and also WIP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I no longer provide a .deb package to install the GM-Companion on Ubuntu systems, use the Launchpad repository instead.&lt;br /&gt; I figured out how to let the program build from git, which allows me to provide the GM-Companion for amd64 systems from Ubuntu 16.10 upwards.&lt;br /&gt; Older versions are unfortunately not supported, as well as 32-bit systems, though that might be possible in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

Released version 0.3.0.1
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;This version fixes a path issue under Windows and some minor bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name generator was broken when using a windows installer.&lt;br /&gt; Also the blog was not shown correctly, it always scrolled down to the first post.&lt;br /&gt; The window size of the Linux version was glitchy so I fixed that as well. Though I know there is still a bug with screen resolutions  smaller than 1920x1080 but I still do not know what causes it. Maybe I can fix those issues in the next version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beta 3.0 has just been released!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be downloaded from &lt;a href='https://github.com/PhilInTheGaps/GM-Companion/releases/tag/0.3.0.0'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; It is now possible to use an installer for the Windows version and it is available for 32 bit or 64 bit systems.&lt;br /&gt; But for those of you who don't want to install it, downloading a .zip for running the program without installation is also possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately GNU/Linux users currently don't have that choice. I was just not able to create a working .deb package for a simple installation.&lt;br /&gt; That does not mean there won't be one in the future but because I am still new to developing for Linux systems that will take some time...&lt;br /&gt; I hope that one day there will be a repository to install it via apt-get.&lt;br /&gt; Until that day you will have to use the .tar.gz package, extract it and run the &quot;gm-companion&quot; runtime.&lt;br /&gt; I will post more detailed instructions to the &lt;a href='https://github.com/PhilInTheGaps/GM-Companion/wiki/Installation'&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the change from Java to Qt5/C++ I am unfortunately no longer able to provide a version for &quot;Mac OS X&quot; Systems, as I don't own such a device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I hope you enjoy this version of the &quot;GM-Companion&quot;!&lt;br /&gt; And if you do indeed find a bug, click &lt;i&gt;Help-&gt;Report a Bug&lt;/i&gt; and it will take you to the &quot;Issues&quot; page of the GitHub repository where you can describe your problem.&lt;br /&gt; I will try to fix it as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
