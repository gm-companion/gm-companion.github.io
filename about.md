The GM-Companion is a tool written by a german student who simply enjoys playing RPGs.

It aims to support the gamemaster of a RPG session by providing lots of different tools that were developed after after we played a round and the gamemaster (sometimes me, sometimes friends of mine) said something like "It would be cool if there was a tool for that".

The goal is to make playing RPGs easier and more enjoyable for everyone. So if you have anything you want to see added or improved, just contact me and maybe I will implement it.  Or you can always make changes yourself and help developing the GM-Companion. It's open source and I don't exactly have a problem with a helping hand :)

As always, have fun playing!  

Phil
