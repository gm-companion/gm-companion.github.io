Quick Progress Update
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;As I have not done anything with this website in the past 6 months, here is an update:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last blog post here indicates that I released Beta 3.1.&lt;br /&gt; Well, actually I have released two newer versions since then but have completely forgotten to put updates out here, especially since I removed the start page which would display this blog from within the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't want to go into too much detail on everything that has changed since version 0.3.1, partly because I am currently working on the first stable release version.&lt;br /&gt; That one will contain another UI overhaul, lots of improvements to existing tools and also some new ones which I find to be really useful.&lt;br /&gt; When I have the time, I will probably do a blog post on some of the coolest new features version 1.0 will have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when will it come out?&lt;br /&gt; I don't know. There is still a lot of work to be done. Partly because it's not just the programming, but because I also want to write a nice documentation for everything to improve the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that's it for now, hopefully I will have more to show in the next weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

Released version 0.3.1
</title>
<description>
 &lt;p&gt;Beta 3.1 has been released!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This update introduces a notes system, translation support and improves the UI.&lt;br /&gt; Custom Qt-StyleSheets are supported as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also introduces the concept of addons for specific rpg systems.&lt;br /&gt; This feature is still under development and will have more features in the future.&lt;br /&gt; Currently there are two addons available:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;DSA5 (The Dark Eye, though currently only available in German)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SIFRP (A Song of Ice and Fire Roleplaying)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Official addons for other systems will be available in the future and there will also be an Addon-Creator for you to create your own addons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addons can add system specific units to the unit converter, notes and the SIFRP addon enables a SIFRP House Generator.&lt;br /&gt; Again, this will change in future updates.&lt;br /&gt; Addons can be installed with the AddonManager via the new &quot;Options&quot; window.&lt;br /&gt; The AddonManager is written in Java and also WIP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I no longer provide a .deb package to install the GM-Companion on Ubuntu systems, use the Launchpad repository instead.&lt;br /&gt; I figured out how to let the program build from git, which allows me to provide the GM-Companion for amd64 systems from Ubuntu 16.10 upwards.&lt;br /&gt; Older versions are unfortunately not supported, as well as 32-bit systems, though that might be possible in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

Released version 0.3.0.1
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;This version fixes a path issue under Windows and some minor bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name generator was broken when using a windows installer.&lt;br /&gt; Also the blog was not shown correctly, it always scrolled down to the first post.&lt;br /&gt; The window size of the Linux version was glitchy so I fixed that as well. Though I know there is still a bug with screen resolutions  smaller than 1920x1080 but I still do not know what causes it. Maybe I can fix those issues in the next version.&lt;/p&gt;

Ubuntu ppa is now available!
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;I finally did it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok I know. I said it would take some time until the GM-Companion is released as a source package in a repository for GNU/Linux systems.&lt;br /&gt; But investing so much time in trying to do it and then giving up was somehow not acceptable for me.  So I simply invested even more time and now finally it is here. At least for Ubuntu 17.04 amd64 systems. I proudly present:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;ppa:rophil/gm-companion&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To add it to your system, open the terminal and type&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;sudo add-apt-repository ppa:rophil/gm-companion&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Then to install the program type&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;sudo apt-get update&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This updates the list of available software, so that the GM-Companion is available.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;sudo apt-get install gm-companion&lt;/i&gt; Should install the program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start it, simply type &lt;i&gt;gm-companion&lt;/i&gt; in the terminal and everything should (!) work.&lt;br /&gt; Maybe it does not. If it doesn't please open a GitHub Issue and report the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If &lt;i&gt;sudo apt-get update&lt;/i&gt; leads to an error regarding the public key, visit the wiki installation page.&lt;br /&gt; I will add a possible solution there.&lt;/p&gt;

Released version 0.3
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Beta 3.0 has just been released!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be downloaded from &lt;a href='https://github.com/PhilInTheGaps/GM-Companion/releases/tag/0.3.0.0'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; It is now possible to use an installer for the Windows version and it is available for 32 bit or 64 bit systems.&lt;br /&gt; But for those of you who don't want to install it, downloading a .zip for running the program without installation is also possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately GNU/Linux users currently don't have that choice. I was just not able to create a working .deb package for a simple installation.&lt;br /&gt; That does not mean there won't be one in the future but because I am still new to developing for Linux systems that will take some time...&lt;br /&gt; I hope that one day there will be a repository to install it via apt-get.&lt;br /&gt; Until that day you will have to use the .tar.gz package, extract it and run the &quot;gm-companion&quot; runtime.&lt;br /&gt; I will post more detailed instructions to the &lt;a href='https://github.com/PhilInTheGaps/GM-Companion/wiki/Installation'&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the change from Java to Qt5/C++ I am unfortunately no longer able to provide a version for &quot;Mac OS X&quot; Systems, as I don't own such a device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I hope you enjoy this version of the &quot;GM-Companion&quot;!&lt;br /&gt; And if you do indeed find a bug, click &lt;i&gt;Help-&gt;Report a Bug&lt;/i&gt; and it will take you to the &quot;Issues&quot; page of the GitHub repository where you can describe your problem.&lt;br /&gt; I will try to fix it as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

Beta 3.0 Release Coming Soon!
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;Expect beta 3.0 to be released in the next days!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are currently testing the second release candidate of beta 3.0 and I am working on the linux port.&lt;br /&gt; If there are no major bugs that require fixing, the new version should be out tomorrow or the day after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the program was completely rewritten since beta 2.9.1 the new version should be way more performance efficient.&lt;br /&gt; Also you can expect some cool new features like a name generator or a character overview.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am also working on updating the wiki but to be honest, that is really time consuming and could take some days as releasing the new version has a higher priority.&lt;/p&gt;
