This version fixes a path issue under Windows and some minor bugs.

The name generator was broken when using a windows installer.  
Also the blog was not shown correctly, it always scrolled down to the first post.  
The window size of the Linux version was glitchy so I fixed that as well. Though I know there is still a bug with screen resolutions 
smaller than 1920x1080 but I still do not know what causes it. Maybe I can fix those issues in the next version.
